# nemo CHANGELOG

## 2.3.2
- Added missing shortstop handlers (glob, file, require, exec)

## v2.3.1

- Fix: [#115](https://github.com/paypal/nemo/issues/115)
- %j placeholder for debug module doesn't print Error objects. %s should be used instead for Strings and Error objects.
%j is appropriate where we expect JSON objects and want logger to convert JSON.stringify() for us
- Enhanced error message when plugin is not found
- Changed default local unit tests to run on PhantomJS only
- Added section to elaborate on how to run unit tests
